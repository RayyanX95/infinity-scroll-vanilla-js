# Infinity Scroll Vanilla JS

The Implementation of ***Infinity Scroll*** using vanilla JavaScript.

*The solution is built using **vanilla JS**, **HTML**, **CSS** and **bootstrap** and without any dependencies or packages*

## Infinity Scroll
It is about creating infinity scroll using **vanilla ES6+ JavaScript**. It uses the CSS loader and the card that is created in the first two tasks. 
Also it has a mock data source using JS promises. The promise will not use an HTTP call but uses a callback function to load the data.

**It contains five files:**
* `index.html`
* `styles.css`
* `app.js`: *It contains the logic of loading data and rendering the cards*
* `data.js`: *It contains the data source*
* `bundle.js`: *It is the actual JavaScript file that is attached to the `index.html` file. It is produced from bundling `app.js` and `data.js` using [Browserify](https://browserify.org/)*

**How to run it:**

Go to *index.html* and double-click on this file
